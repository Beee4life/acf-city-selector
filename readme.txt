Customise your ACF install with a field to select a City based on country and state.

== Description ==

ACF City Selector is a plugin which offers a function which is often asked about on the ACF forums; a city selector, based on country and provcence/state. After failing to find a proper solution myself, I built my own to try and solve the issue once and for all :)

It was built, based on this [tutorial post](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/tutorials/creating-a-new-field-type/), whcih explains how to create your own field type.

I took a piece of code by [Fabrizio Sabato](https://github.com/fab01) and customised that into this plugin.

= Field Types =

* Select (3 drop down lists of choices; Country, State/Provence, City)

= Tested on =
* Mac Chrome
* more browsers/os to come when plugin is finished

= Plugin website =

https://acfcs.berryplasman.com

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'acf-city-selector' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click on 'Add Field' in a Custom Field Group and add the 'City Selector' field
