Customise your ACF install with a field to select a City based on country and state.

== Description ==

ACF City Selector is a plugin which offers a function which is often asked about on the ACF forums; a city selector, based on country and provcence/state. After failing to find a proper solution myself, I built my own to try and solve the issue once and for all :)

I took a piece of code by [Fabrizio Sabato](https://github.com/fab01) and customised that into this plugin.

* Select (3 drop down lists of choices; Country, State/Provence, City)
